    "## Define Object Oriented Programming Language ?\n",

    "# Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "## Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm based on the concept of objects, which can contain data, in the form of fields, and code, in the form of procedures. A feature of objects is an object's procedures that can access and often modify the data fields of the object with which they are associated."

    "## List down the benifits of OOP ?\n",
    "\n",
    "# Answer :\n",
    "\n",
    "## * It provides a clear modular structure for programs which makes it good for defining abstract datatypes in which implementation details are hidden.\n",
    "\n",
    "## * Objects can also be reused within an across applications. The reuse of software also lowers the cost of development. More effort is put into the object-oriented analysis and design, which lowers the overall cost of development.\n",
    "\n",
    "## * It makes software easier to maintain. Since the design is modular, part of the system can be updated in case of issues without a need to make large-scale changes.\n",
    "\n",
    "## * Reuse also enables faster development.Object-oriented programming languages come with rich libraries of objects, and code developed during projects is also reusable in future projects.\n",
    "\n",
    "## * It provides a good framework for code libraries where the supplied software components can be easily adapted and modified by the programmer.This is particularly useful for developing graphical user interfaces (GUI).\n",
    "\n",
    "## * Better Productivity as OOP techniques enforce rules on a programmer that, in the long run, help her get more work done, finished programs work better, have more features and are easier to read and maintain."
